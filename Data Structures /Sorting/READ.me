The Task: 
In order to test the exercises below, write a test case that runs the algorithm on new sets of random data at least 1,000 times.

Use an implementation of the Java comparator interface in order to compare generic elements with each other. 
You are allowed to use List or Arraylist of Java (under java.util). 
Show your graph at the lab (do not upload it), but put any comments using comment (sic) in the submitted code.

a. Implement a generic Mergesort for sorting a List.   
b. Now implement a second version of Mergesort that uses bubblesort to sort sublists of less than 20 elements.
