The Task:
Write a Matlab function to compute the coefficients of the best approximation in the least-squares
sense over the interval [−π, +π] by a trigonometric polynomial (Fourier series) of degree k.

Also write a Matlab code to evaluate the resulting trigonometric polynomial.

Compute the Fourier coefficients up to degree 6, and plot the sk for k = 1, 2, 3. Use the error formula
for least-squares approximation by orthogonal functions to give the errors of sk for k = 1, . . . , 6
