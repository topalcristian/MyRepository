The Task:
Write a Matlab function approximating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix A
using the inverse power method to a given accuracy. 
You may assume that the standard unit basis vectors give suitable starting vectors for the iteration, with corresponding eigenvalue estimates.
Apply your method to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 4 Ã— 4 matrix
